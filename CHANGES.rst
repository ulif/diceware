Changes
=======

1.1.0.dev0 (yet unreleased)
---------------------------

- Change special-char-behaviour: instead of pouring special chars over the
  generated passphrase and thus rendering it glibberish and unreadable (and
  harder to remember), we now append them always at the end of the
  passphrase. Fixed #116.


1.0.1 (2024-12-24)
------------------

Security Upgrade.

- Update dependency list for generating docs. The old dependencies required
  an unsafe version of `jinja2`.


1.0 (2024-12-24)
----------------

Major overhaul of the whole project. We introduce more modern approaches in
project layout (like `pyproject`), use new linters and other tools while we
still support all Python versions from 2.7 up to current 3.12.

We now follow the XDG base directory specification, that tells where config
(and other) files for an application can be found. You now can also use
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/diceware/diceware.ini`, or, if the given var is emtpy or
unset, `${HOME}/.config/diceware/diceware.ini`. The traditional location
`${HOME}/.diceware.ini` is still supported.

Furthermore we read `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/diceware/` (or
`${HOME}/.local/share/diceware/` if `${XDG_DATA_HOME}` is empty or unset) to
lookup further wordlists.

New option `--show-wordlist-dirs` lists all directory locations we search for
contained wordlists.

- Officially support Python 3.10 to 3.12.
- Fixed #86: Follow `XDG <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/>`_ base directory specification.
- Fixed #84: Allow to store wordlists also in custom directories.
- Use `ruff` as linter, drop `flake8`.
- Renew `tox` configuration.
- Switch to `pyproject`-based project layout, away from using `setup.py`.
- Fixed #62: Removed `pkg_resources` dependency. Kudos to @htgoebel!
  As a side effect no randomness sources from other packages are supported anymore.
- Added French wordlist. Many thanks for the good work go to Tango.
- Added Catalan, Spanish and Italian wordlists.


0.10 (2022-02-15)
-----------------

- Officially support Python 3.8 and Python 3.9.
- Removed official support for pypy2, Python 2.6, and Python 3.3.
- Allow to specify several wordlists in order to create syntactical valid
  phrases.
- Also added first wordlists with english adjectives/nouns to generate for
  instance <adjective-noun> phrases that are easier to memorize.
- When using real dice, allow entering of several rolls at once. Patch from
  `Adin Hoyle <alan@alanhoyle.com>`_.
- Added german wordlists.
- Added carefully compiled brazilian portugese wordlist. Kudos to @drebs.
- Removed original diceware wordlists temporarily, for containing bad terms (#85)


0.9.6 (2018-12-19)
------------------

- Officially support Python 3.7.
- Fixed #51: Fix to formatting of list in Wordlists section. Kudos to `Doug
  Muth <https://github.com/dmuth>`_.


0.9.5 (2018-04-07)
------------------

- Fixed #28: use Debian-compliant, machine-readable copyright format. Kudos to
  `Simon Fondrie-Teitler <https://github.com/simonft>`_ and @anarcat.
- Fixed #48: Clarify trademark status of diceware. Mr. Reinhold granted
  permission to use the name 'Diceware' in this project and under the conditions
  listed in the issue comments. Many thanks to him!


0.9.4 (2018-02-27)
------------------

- Set default logging level to ERROR (was: CRITICAL)
- Fixed #44: provide a short and readable file-not-found message (many thanks to
  `bhavin192 <https://github.com/bhavin192>`_)
- Fixed #45: clean up logging handlers after test runs.
- Removed date-dependent tests from default test suite. Run ``py.test -m ''``
  or ``tox`` to run them.


0.9.3 (2017-09-14)
------------------

- Fix broken test.


0.9.2 (2017-09-14)
------------------

- Fixed #33. Make `en_eff` the new default wordlist. This results in slightly
  decreased entropy per word (12.92 bits instead of 13.0), but provides prefix
  code and better memorizable words. Thanks to @anarcat for the suggestion.
- Fixed #35. Make `realdice` source of randomness provide an equal distribution
  of roll numbers even for sequences shorter than number of dice sides.
- Added a man page.
- Support Python 3.6.
- Import `ConfigParser` instead of `SafeConfigParser` if the latter is an alias
  of the former.
- Fixed #37. Ensure file descriptors are closed properly.
- Fixed #38. Get wordlists dir by function (instead of const) to allow
  reproducible builds. Kudos go to @drebs, again.


0.9.1 (2016-12-24)
------------------

- Fixed #32, in docs tell that ``--no-caps`` option does not generate
  lower-case terms.
- Fixed #31, broken `realdice` source of randomness. `argparse` related bug,
  Bug was discovered and fixed by @LogosOfJ, thanks a lot!
- Fixed #29. Tell about code prefix problem in README.
- Activated logging. Using `verbose` will result in additional output.


0.9 (2016-09-14)
----------------

- Added `--dice-sides` option to tell how many sides used dices
  provide.
- Changed API interface of `get_config_dict()` to allow more flexible
  handling of config files.
- Support different verbosity levels.
- Added new wordlist ``en_eff``. It is a 7776-terms list provided by
  the Electronic Frontier Foundation. See
  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases
  for details. Thanks to `George V. Reilly
  <https://github.com/georgevreilly>`_ for hinting!
- Fixed #27. Allow dashes in numbered wordlists. Yet, these looked
  like ``1234 myterm``. We now also accept ``1-2-3-4 myterm``.


0.8 (2016-05-07)
----------------

- Closed #23. @dwcoder provided a fix that allows use of
  whitespace-only values in diceware config files if they are enclosed
  in quotes.
- Fixed #21. @dwcoder revealed and fixed (again!). This time `--caps`
  and `--no-caps` settings did not work properly when set in CLI or in
  `.diceware.ini` config file.
- Shortened real-dice randomness source.
- Added logger as common interface to send messages to users.
- New dependency: `sphinx_rtd_theme` for generating docs. This theme
  was formerly a dependency of `Sphinx`.


0.7.1 (2016-04-21)
------------------

- Fixed #19. @dwcoder revealed and fixed a nasty bug in the real-dice
  randomness-source. Thanks a lot!


0.7 (2016-04-17)
----------------

- Added sample ``.diceware.ini``.
- Added new english wordlist ``en_securedrop``. This is the new
  default list. Thanks to `heartsucker
  <https://github.com/heartsucker>`_ who compiled and added the list.
- Remove support for Python 3.2. Several packages we depend on for testing
  and sandboxing stopped Python 3.2 support. We follow them.


0.6.1 (2015-12-15)
------------------

- Minor doc changes: add separate config file docs.
- Fix docs: the default wordlist is named ``en``. Some docs were not
  up-to-date in that regard.


0.6 (2015-12-15)
----------------

- Officially support Python 3.5.
- Tests do not depend on `pytest-cov`, `pytest-xdist` anymore.
- Support configuration files. You can set different defaults in a
  file called ``.diceware.ini`` in your home directory.
- Renamed wordlist ``en_8k`` to ``en`` as it serves as the default
  for english passphrases.


0.5 (2015-08-05)
----------------

- New option ``-r``, ``--randomsource``. We support a pluggable system
  to define alternative sources of randomness. Currently supported
  sources: ``"system"`` (to retrieve randomness from standard library,
  default) and ``realdice``, which allows use of real dice.
- New option ``-w``, ``--wordlist``. We now provide several wordlists
  for users to choose from. Own wordlists could already be fed to
  `diceware` before. By default we still use the 8192 words list from
  http://diceware.com.
- Rename `SRC_DIR` to `WORDLISTS_DIR` (reflecting what it stands for).
- Use also flake8 with tox.
- Pass `options` to `get_passphrase()` instead of a bunch of single args.
- Output wordlists dir in help output.


0.4 (2015-03-30)
----------------

- Add --delimiter option (thanks to Rodolfo Gouveia).


0.3.1 (2015-03-29)
------------------

- Turned former `diceware` module into a Python package. This is to
  fix `bug #1 Wordlists aren't included during installation
  <https://github.com/ulif/diceware/issues/1>`_, this time really.
  Wordlists will from now on be stored inside the `diceware` package.
  Again many thanks to `conorsch <https://github.com/conorsch>`_ who
  digged deep into the matter and also came up with a very considerable
  solution.
- Use readthedocs theme in docs.


0.3 (2015-03-28)
----------------

- Fix `bug #1 Wordlists aren't included during installation
  <https://github.com/ulif/diceware/issues/1>`_ . Thanks to `conorsch
  <https://github.com/conorsch>`_
- Add --version option.


0.2 (2015-03-27)
----------------

- Minor documentation changes.
- Updated copyright infos.
- Add support for custom wordlists.


0.1 (2015-02-18)
----------------

- Initial release.
