Wordlists
=========

The passphrases generated by `diceware` naturally depend on the set of
words used, the wordlists.

`diceware` comes with some wordlists out-of-the-box, that might be a
good choice for usual private use.

By default we use the so-called `8k wordlist`_ from Mr. Reinhold as
published on http://diceware.com/. It contains 8,192 english words
and phrases.

.. warning:: We do -- by default -- *not* use the `diceware standard
	     wordlist`_ (which contains 7,776 words), because
	     computers prefer powers of two and we use the Python
	     standard lib random source by default (we do not want to
	     waste entropy).

	     But the "original" list is included in diceware as well
	     and you can pick it with the ``-w en_orig`` option.  You
	     *should* pick it when you use real dice as source of
	     randomness.

You can pick another list with the ``-w`` or ``--wordlist`` option.


Add Own Wordlists
-----------------

You can use any wordlist you like. Simply give the filename and it
will be used::

  $ diceware mywordlist.txt
  HiHelloHelloHiHiHi

You can even pipe-in dynamic wordlists. Just use the dash ``-`` as
filename::

  $ cat mywordgenerator.sh | diceware -
  HiHiHelloHiHiHello

for instance.

Of course you have to give the filenames of your files with each call
to `diceware`.

But, if you want to store a wordlist persistently, you can do so too.

The wordlists we offer for use with `diceware` are all stored in a
single folder. The exact location is output by ``--help`` at the very
end::

  $ diceware --help
  ...
  Wordlists are stored in /some/path/to/folder

Just put your own wordlists into this folder (here:
``/some/path/to/folder``) and rename the file to something like
``wordlist_MY_SPECIAL_NAME.txt``. Afterwards you can pick your
wordlist by running::

  $ diceware -w MY_SPECIAL_NAME

`diceware` will use this file of yours then to create a
passphrase. Please note that `diceware` only accepts files that are
named like::

  wordlist_NAME.txt

or::

  wordlist_OTHER_NAME.asc

I.e. we expect ``wordlist_`` at the beginning and some filename
extension like ``.txt`` at the end. Furthermore names must not contain
funny characters. In fact we accept regular letters, dashes, numbers,
and underscores only. Files that do not follow these naming convention
are ignored.

A list of all available wordlist names can also be retrieved with
``--help``. See the ``--wordlist`` explanation.


Plain Wordlists
---------------

Out of the box, `diceware` supports plain wordlists, PGP-signed
wordlists, and numbered wordlists. Plain wordlists look like this::

  termone
  termtwo
  anotherterm

Each line in such a file is considered a word of the wordlist. Empty
lines are ignored.

Whitespaces are allowed if they are not at the beginning or end of a
line, stripped off otherwise.


Numbered Wordlists
------------------

Numbered wordlists contain numbers in each line, telling a
sequence of dice rolls like so::

  11111    aterm
  11112    anotherterm
  ...

`diceware` detects such lines and in this case extracts ``aterm`` and
``anotherterm`` as wordlist entries.


PGP-signed Wordlists
--------------------

PGP-signed wordlists are wordlists (ordinary or numbered ones), that
have been cryptographically signed with PGP or GPG. They look like
this::

  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  Hash: SHA512

  foo
  bar
  baz

  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
  Version: GnuPG v1
  
  iJwEAQEKAAYFAlW00GEACgkQ+5ktCoLaPzSutwP8DVgdjBFqRXNKaZlvd8pR+P3k
  8xx5XLC0OFwZQFx4Ls8xl3+/xfvCNxCGSZjD6BGPzNZCK7bmQQYWcrsoEyX5jAC3
  dXjAPj0nct/PkJQlrUjUI2qrO0dFfU7sRj0Gn9TOlQQkKoQVwy7pY/6HaScGNepL
  J8BNUPYdOWeVgxY1jSY=
  =WXfu
  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

and are normally stored with the ``.asc`` filename extension. Signed
wordlists can be verified to detect changes, although this is not
automatically done by `diceware`.

.. warning:: Diceware does *not* automatically verify PGP-signed
             files.
