    `path_or_filelike` is the path of the wordlist file or an already
    opened file. Opened files must be open for reading, of course. We
    expect filelike objects to support at least `read()`.

    If a file-like object does not support `seek()` (like `sys.stdin`),
    we create a temporary, seekable copy of the input stream. The copy
    is written to disk only, if it is larger than
    `MAX_IN_MEM_SIZE`. Otherwise the wordlist is kept in memory.

    Please note that open file descriptors are not closed after reading.

    Wordlist files are expected to contain words, one word per
    line. Empty lines are ignored, also whitespaces before or trailing
    a line are stripped. If a "word" contains inner whitespaces, then
    these are preserved.

    The input file can be a signed wordlist. Signed wordlists are
    expected to be ordinary lists of words but with ASCII armored
    signatures (as described in RFC 4880).

    In case of signed wordlists the signature headers/footers are
    stripped and the contained list of words is read.

    WordList are generators. That means, that you can retrieve the
    words of a wordlist by iterating over an instance of `WordList`.
