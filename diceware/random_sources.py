"""Sources of randomness.

Please register all sources as entry point in ``setup.py``. Look out for
"SystemRandomSource" for an example.

For developers of interfaces to other sources of randomness: Currently,
you can extend `diceware` random sources by registering a class, that
provides a suitable `__init__(self, options)` and a `choice(self,
sequence)` method. Optionally, you can also provide a `classmethod`
called ``update_arparse`` that will get the possibility to update the
`argparser.ArgumentParser` used by `diceware`.

The `__init__` method of your class will be called with `options`, a set
of options as parsed from the commandline. The initialization code can
use the options to determine further actions or ignore it. The
`__init__` method is also the right place to ask users for one-time
infos you need. This includes infos like the number of sides of a dice,
an API key for random.org or other infos that should not change between
generating different words (but might change from one `diceware` call
to the next).

The `choice` method then, will get a sequence of chars, strings, or
numbers and should pick one of them based on the source of randomness
intended to be utilized by your code. If further user interaction is
required, `choice` might also ask users for input or similar. Typically,
`choice` is called once for each word and once for each special char to
generate.

If you want to manage own commandline options with your plugin, you can
implement a `classmethod` called ``update_argparser(parser)`` which gets
an `argparse.ArgumentParser` instance  as argument (no pun intended).

Finally, to register the source, add some stanza in `setup.py` of your
project that looks like::

    # ...
    setup(
        # ...
        entry_points={
            # console scripts and other entry points...
            'diceware_random_sources': [
                'myrandom = mypkg.mymodule:MyRandomSource',
                'myothersrc = mypkg.mymodule:MyOtherSource',
            ],
        },
        # ...
    )
    # ...

Here the `myrandom` and `myothersrc` lines register random sources that
(if installed) `diceware` will find on startup and offer to users under
the name given. In the described case, users could do for instance::

  diceware -r myrandom

and the random source defined in the given class would be used for
generating a passphrase.
